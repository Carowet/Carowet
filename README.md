Hi, I'm Caro, Full-Stack Developer 👩🏼‍💻

I embarked on my coding journey in 2017 when I had to learn HTML and CSS under 48 hours for a student association project. In 2019, I applied to Ecole 42, a leading coding school in Paris, France, and was eligible to take the 1-month coding exam in June 2020.

Unfortunately, said exam was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which prompted me to look for an alternative once I graduated from my MSc in Entrepreneurship and Business Development in 2021 🎓. Ultimately, I was selected to attend Le Wagon in Berlin (graduated in March 2022). 🚀

I am now working as a web developer for Mooncard.
