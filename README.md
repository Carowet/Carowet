Hi, I'm Caro, Full-Stack Developer 👩🏼‍💻

I embarked on my coding journey in 2017 when I had to learn HTML and CSS under 48 hours for a student association project. In 2019, I applied to Ecole 42, a leading coding school in Paris, France, and was eligible to take the 1-month coding exam in June 2020.

Unfortunately, said exam was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which prompted me to look for an alternative once I graduated from my MSc in Entrepreneurship and Business Development in 2021 🎓. Ultimately, I was selected to attend Le Wagon in Berlin, where I had just moved to work in a startup incubator 🚀

As a program manager in the incubator, I have met and supported tens of entrepreneurs and software developers, further strengthening my interest in coding.



**Languages - Frameworks - Tools**

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6, SQL, git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails.
Currently learning React and Node.js
